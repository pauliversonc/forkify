# Forkify

## Description

Forkify is a vanilla JavaScript application that interacts with the Forkify API to fetch and display recipe food data. This app uses modern JavaScript tools, such as Parcel to bundle the modules, and Babel to convert ES6, ES7, ES8, ES9 and ESNext back to ES5.

## Disclaimer

This Forkify project was built using **HTML**, **Sass**, and **JavaScript** during my bootcamp on Udemy to enhance my skills in advanced JavaScript methods.

The user interface for this project was designed and built by our teacher, **Jonas Schmedtmann**. All credit for the UI design goes to him. The main focus of this project was to build the functionality of the application using JavaScript.
